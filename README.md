### Webstore Web Application
This project is a REST API that allows users to perform CRUD Operations on products as well as allowing these users to write reviews on these products as well as to rate them on a scale from 1-100. This project uses Java paired with Springboot for the backend and uses React for the front end.

React Toastify
React Bootstrap
Bootstrap
React DOM
React Router Dom

## This Project Uses The Following On The Back End (Intelli J)
Java
Springboot
Spring Security

## Installation Process 
To Install You should first Clone The Repository
Then create a Firebase account and set up the database
Replace the values in the Firebase configuration values with your own
You should do the same for the .env File and replace all given values
Since I used a PostgreSQL database you should aim to use one as well if you want to duplicate my results.

Once you've done the above on the backend using Intelli J you can simply set your main file to the WebstoreDemoApplication.java file and run it
On the front end you can type `npm run dev` in the terminal and that should run the local host port
